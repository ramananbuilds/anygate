# Changelog

## 0.5.7 (2026-07-20)

This release makes the **favorites catalog** work end-to-end — in the CLI, in the
Claude Desktop app, **and now from the web UI** — and polishes the Apps & Launch
experience. Picking "⭐ Favorites Catalog" (or the UI's "All favorites" launch mode)
opens your agent with *every* saved favorite model routed through one anygate
gateway, so you can switch live from the in-app model menu.

### Web UI — launch the full favorites catalog
- The Apps & Launch launch modal now offers a clear **3-mode selector**:
  - **All favorites** — opens the app with every saved favorite routed through
    one anygate gateway (the full catalog, not just the first).
  - **One model** — launch with a single pre-selected provider/model.
  - **Just open** — launch the app with no model pre-set.
- The backend (`POST /api/apps/launch`) gains a `favoritesCatalog` flag that emits
  a bare `anygate <app> --favorites` (full catalog) instead of resolving to the
  first favorite. The legacy single-favorite path is kept.
- `AppCard` shows a "favorites ready" badge and a contextual launch CTA.
- The Dashboard "Apps & Launch" card is relabeled with a clarifying note.

### Claude Desktop favorites catalog (CLI)
- Favorites resolve from the same catalog/agent as the picker, so every saved
  favorite appears in the Claude Desktop model picker — including cloud-code
  (Antigravity) favorites, served through their dedicated backend and merged.
- `--favorites` now launches the catalog **directly** — no interactive provider
  picker. When favorites exist, `anygate claude-app --favorites` goes straight
  into the multi-route catalog launch.
- The provider prompt is now labeled for the correct agent (e.g. "Which provider
  for **Claude**?") instead of always saying "Codex".
- The provider picker now **defaults to "⭐ Favorites Catalog"** when favorites
  exist, instead of remembering the last single-provider selection.
- Duplicate registry models (e.g. `mistral-medium-2604`) are de-duplicated so the
  Claude Desktop picker shows the correct number of rows.
- Added `tests/claude-app.test.ts` asserting the full favorites catalog is served
  via the masked `/anthropic/v1/models` discovery payload.

## 0.5.6 (2026-07-19)

### Long-session context handling (Claude Desktop / Codex / Claude Code)
- **Models keep working when the context window fills.** New `fitContextWindow`
  trims the oldest conversation turns (preserving the system prompt, the most
  recent messages, and paired `tool_use`/`tool_result` blocks) so small-window
  upstreams like Nemotron 3 Ultra (131K) keep generating in long sessions instead
  of erroring out or freezing at zero tokens — the same resilience Antigravity
  gets from Gemini's large window, now available to the other agents.
- **Better streaming errors.** When an upstream fails mid-stream, the proxy now
  emits a proper Anthropic `error` SSE event instead of an empty stream, so the
  client shows the failure instead of appearing frozen.
- `translateRequest` now accepts `contextWindow` and clamps `max_output_tokens`
  to stay within the fitted window.

### Input-type / multimodal capability resolution
- New `resolveInputTypes` derives a concrete `['text']` / `['text','image']`
  capability per model from models.dev, with conservative family overrides for
  known-multimodal models that models.dev under-reports (e.g. NVIDIA Nemotron 3
  Ultra).
- Input types are advertised through the Anthropic model catalog
  (`input_types`), the gateway proxy `/v1/models` payload, `localModelToRoute`,
  and the Antigravity catalog (`supportsImages`), and exposed via the `anygate ui`
  models API.
- `aliasModelId` now sanitizes slashes, spaces, and parentheses in model ids so
  gateway-discovery aliases stay valid.

### UI
- Model list gains a click-to-open **detail drawer** (ModelDetailDrawer) showing
  capabilities, badges, and metadata; rows and filters updated to surface
  input-type badges.

### Internal
- Added `tests/context-fit.test.ts` and `tests/input-types.test.ts`.
- `AnthropicMsg` / `AnthropicBlock` exported from `sdk-adapter` for reuse.
- Proxy route lookup now logs not-found aliases / model ids via `quietErrorLog`.

## 0.5.5 (2026-07-19)

### Dashboard analytics fixes
- **Activity heatmap now reflects real usage only.** The per-day color intensity
  is bucketed by **daily token volume** (not raw request count), and every day
  with usage is guaranteed a visible color (level 1–4 scaled by volume relative
  to your busiest day). Unused days render as solid black squares — no more
  uniformly "highlighted" cubes.
- **Heatmap tooltips** now show token volume per day (e.g. `2026-07-18 · 211.8M tokens`).
- **Antigravity usage is counted and attributed.** The Cloud Code gateway logs
  token usage per request (app label `Antigravity`), so activity from the
  Antigravity app now appears in the dashboard instead of being invisible.
- **Model breakdown shows source-app badges.** Each model row displays the apps
  that contributed usage (`gateway`, `Antigravity`, …), and gateway + Antigravity
  entries for the same physical model are merged into one row.
- **Token volume chart** auto-scrolls to the most recent day on load so real
  usage is visible up front (no hidden scroll), with active days highlighted.
- Real-data-only dashboard: the mock fallback was removed; the store shows an
  "Offline" badge if the analytics API is unreachable rather than fake numbers.
- `B` (billion) token formatting appears automatically once combined totals
  cross 1e9 tokens.

### Internal
- `HeatDay.count` now carries the day's token total (drives color + tooltip).
- Gateway model-id normalization so Antigravity and gateway entries for the same
  model converge in the breakdown.
- Added test isolation for the Antigravity gateway tests (throwaway temp dir)
  so they no longer pollute the real `~/.anygate/analytics.jsonl`.
