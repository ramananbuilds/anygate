# Claude Desktop setup

Point **Claude Desktop** at an **anygate** gateway on your machine. You get OpenCode Zen, Go, and your OpenCode-configured providers (Groq, Mistral, OpenAI, Gemini, Ollama, etc.) in Desktop's model picker, with a catalog size you control.

**What's available:** With third-party inference, Desktop gives you **Cowork** and **Code** only. The regular **Chat** tab (claude.ai-style chat inside the app) is not available in this mode.

Anthropic calls this **third-party inference** in the Developer menu. Configure the gateway, launch Claude Desktop, pick a model, then use Cowork or Code.

For Anthropic's upstream docs, see [Installation and setup](https://claude.com/docs/cowork/3p/installation) and [Configuration reference](https://claude.com/docs/cowork/3p/configuration).

## What you get

| Piece | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `anygate server` | Local OpenCode gateway on port **17645** — Zen, Go, and registry-configured providers |
| Claude Desktop gateway config | Desktop sends inference to your machine instead of only claude.ai |
| Server wizard filters | Exposed providers, optional favorites-only catalog, discovery id masking |
| **Cowork** tab | Agentic sessions (files, research, multi-step tasks) against your gateway models |
| **Code** tab | Claude Code inside Desktop, against your gateway models |

**Not included:** Chat (the standard claude.ai chat UI in Desktop). If you need that, sign in to Claude Desktop normally without a custom gateway, or use claude.ai in the browser.

Billing runs through your OpenCode / OpenCode-configured provider keys. Keep the server terminal open while you use Desktop.

---

## Known limitations

These are Anthropic product constraints, not anygate bugs. Gateway users should plan around them.

| Feature | With anygate gateway (3P) | With Anthropic 1P (normal sign-in) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Chat tab** | Not available | Available |
| **Cowork / Code** | Available | Available (with subscription) |
| **Claude in Chrome** (browser extension) | **Not available** | Requires **Pro, Max, Team, or Enterprise** |

### Claude in Chrome does not work with the gateway

**Claude in Chrome** is Anthropic's Chrome extension for browser automation (navigate sites, fill forms, integrate with Claude Code). It is **not compatible** with third-party inference — including a anygate gateway on `127.0.0.1`.

Anthropic's [Claude Code + Chrome docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/chrome) state:

- Chrome integration requires **a direct Anthropic plan (Pro, Max, Team, or Enterprise)**.
- It is **not available** through third-party providers (Bedrock, Vertex, Foundry, or a custom gateway).
- If you use Claude exclusively through a gateway, you need a **separate claude.ai paid account** to use Claude in Chrome — and that extension routes through **Anthropic's servers**, not your gateway.

**API-only billing does not help.** Console/API keys are separate from claude.ai subscriptions. Claude in Chrome is not unlocked by API credits alone.

**What gateway users can do instead:**

- Use **Cowork and Code** inside Claude Desktop against the anygate server (this guide).
- Use **Claude Code in the terminal** with `anygate claude` and your chosen backend.
- For browser automation, use other tools (e.g. dedicated browser MCP, Playwright) — not Claude in Chrome tied to this gateway.

To use Claude in Chrome, [restore 1P mode](#restore-claude-desktop-to-anthropics-servers) and sign in with a paid claude.ai plan.

---

## Prerequisites

1. **anygate** installed (`npm install -g anygate`).
2. **OpenCode API key** configured at least once (for `anygate server`):
   ```bash
   anygate providers add   # if starting fresh
   anygate claude           # stores key in Keychain / credential store
   ```
3. **A supported Cowork device:**
   - macOS 14 or later on Apple silicon or Intel x64, installed with the `.dmg` package.
   - Windows 10 build 19041 or later on x64 or Arm64, installed with the `.msix` package. The legacy `.exe` installer does not include Cowork.
   - Working hardware virtualization. Anthropic's [Cowork readiness check](https://claude.com/docs/third-party/claude-desktop/installation#check-device-readiness) verifies this and the platform requirements.
4. **Latest Claude Desktop** from [claude.com/download](https://claude.com/download).
5. **Network access to the required services.** Standard installations fetch the Cowork VM workspace and Claude CLI from `downloads.claude.ai`; Claude Desktop also needs access to your configured inference provider.
6. *(Optional)* **OpenCode CLI** with providers configured. Whatever you've set up in OpenCode (Groq, Mistral, OpenAI, Gemini, Ollama, etc.) appears in the server catalog automatically.
7. *(Optional)* **Favorites** via `anygate models` to cap the catalog at up to 20 models.
8. *(Optional)* **Google Vertex** — configure in Claude Desktop (**Developer → third-party inference → Vertex**).

---

## Quick Start: Automated Setup

On macOS or Windows, the easiest way to use Claude Desktop with your local providers is the **automated setup**:

```bash
anygate claude-app
```

1. Run the command above.
2. Select a provider and a model.
3. The command will **automatically enable Developer Mode**, configure the gateway to point to itself, and launch Claude Desktop for you.
4. **Keep the terminal running!** It acts as the live proxy for Claude Desktop.
5. When you are done, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal to stop the proxy and seamlessly restore your original Claude Desktop configuration.

If the terminal crashes or you need to recover your previous state manually, run:
```bash
anygate claude-app --restore
```

---

## Manual Setup (Network/Advanced)

If you are running the gateway on a different machine (like a remote cloud desktop, a local container, or a home server) or want to keep a permanent background gateway, you can configure it manually.

## Step 1: Start the anygate server

In a terminal, start the gateway and **leave it running**:

```bash
anygate server
```

First-time wizard recommendations:

| Prompt | Recommendation |
| --- | --- |
| **Configure & start** vs **Start with saved settings** | *Configure & start* the first time |
| **Exposed providers** | Add only what you want in Desktop (Zen, Go, OpenAI, etc.) |
| **Mask gateway model ids for discovery?** | **Yes**. Claude Desktop filters competitor names in gateway model ids. Masking keeps discovery working while display names stay readable |
| **Expose only favorite models?** | Optional |
| **Listen mode** | **Local only** (`127.0.0.1`) when Desktop runs on the same machine |

When the server is up:

```text
anygate server running
  Anthropic:  http://127.0.0.1:17645/anthropic
  OpenAI:     http://127.0.0.1:17645/openai
  API key:    any non-empty value
```

Quick health check (optional):

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:17645/health
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:17645/anthropic/v1/models | head
```

---

## Step 2: Enable Developer Mode

Third-party inference lives behind **Developer Mode**.

### macOS

From the **menu bar**:

1. **Help** → **Troubleshooting** → **Enable Developer Mode**
2. The app may relaunch. That's normal.

### Windows

From the **application menu (☰)**:

1. **Help** → **Troubleshooting** → **Enable Developer Mode**
2. The app may relaunch. That's normal.

A **Developer** menu appears in the menu bar (macOS) or application menu (Windows).

Anthropic's docs say to configure this from the login screen before signing in. In practice, if you already use Claude Desktop, enable Developer Mode from the menu and move on. You don't need a separate "start mode" button after configuration.

---

## Step 3: Configure third-party inference

1. **Developer** → **Configure third-party inference**
2. Open the **Connection** section in the left sidebar
3. Set:

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Inference provider** | **Gateway** (Anthropic-compatible) |
| **Gateway base URL** | `http://127.0.0.1:17645/anthropic` |
| **Gateway API key** | Any non-empty string (e.g. `anygate`) |
| **Gateway auth scheme** | `bearer` |

**Do not append `/v1` to the base URL.** Claude Desktop adds API paths itself (`/v1/models`, `/v1/messages`). A URL like `.../anthropic/v1` breaks discovery and inference.

4. Leave **model discovery** enabled (default)
5. Hit **Test connection** and **Test model discovery** if those buttons are there
6. Click **Apply locally**. The app saves config and relaunches

Config lands here:

| Platform | Path |
| --- | --- |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/Claude-3p/configLibrary/` |
| Windows | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Claude-3p\configLibrary\` |

The `Claude-3p` folder name is Anthropic's on-disk layout for third-party inference. You can ignore it day to day.

---

## Step 4: Use Claude Desktop

After **Apply locally**, open Claude Desktop like you normally would.

1. Make sure `anygate server` is still running in a terminal
2. Open the **Cowork** or **Code** tab (Chat won't be there)
3. Open the model picker. You should see models from your gateway
4. Pick a model and start a session

If discovery worked in Step 3's **Test model discovery**, you're done. No extra launch step.

Some Anthropic docs describe a sign-in screen option for enterprise deployments that skip Anthropic accounts entirely. Most people setting this up at home never see that. If you don't see it, ignore it.

## Gateway values cheat sheet

| Setting | Local anygate server |
| --- | --- |
| Provider | Gateway (Anthropic-compatible) |
| Base URL | `http://127.0.0.1:17645/anthropic` |
| API key | Any non-empty value (local mode has no server password) |
| Auth scheme | `bearer` |
| Discovery (internal) | `GET http://127.0.0.1:17645/anthropic/v1/models` |
| Messages (internal) | `POST http://127.0.0.1:17645/anthropic/v1/messages` |

### Network mode (another device on your LAN)

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Base URL | `http://<server-ip>:17645/anthropic` |
| API key | The **server password** printed when the server started |

## Restore Claude Desktop to Anthropic's servers

To stop routing through anygate and return to normal Claude Desktop (Anthropic sign-in, Chat tab, claude.ai inference):

### Verified revert (macOS, Claude Desktop 1.11847.5)

Tested end-to-end. Three on-disk changes plus a relaunch:

| What | Why |
| --- | --- |
| Remove `Claude-3p/configLibrary/` | Drops the gateway config (`inferenceProvider: gateway`) that keeps Desktop in 3P mode |
| Set `"allowDevTools": false` | Hides the **Developer** menu — current Claude Desktop has **Enable** Developer Mode in the UI but no **Disable** toggle |
| Set `"deploymentMode": "1p"` | Pins first-party mode in the standard `Claude/` data folder |

**Before you start:** fully quit Claude Desktop (`Cmd+Q` on macOS — not just close the window). Back up the folders below if you want an undo path.

#### Step 1 — Remove the gateway config

**macOS:**

```bash
rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude-3p/configLibrary/
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Claude-3p\configLibrary"
```

This deletes the applied third-party inference profile (e.g. `inferenceGatewayBaseUrl: http://127.0.0.1:17645/anthropic`). It does **not** delete Cowork session history under `Claude-3p/` or `~/Claude/`.

#### Step 2 — Disable Developer Mode (manual)

Claude Desktop v1.11847.5 stores Developer Mode in `developer_settings.json` under the **standard** (1P) data folder — not `Claude-3p/`:

**macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/developer_settings.json`

**Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\developer_settings.json`

Set:

```json
{
  "allowDevTools": false
}
```

If the file does not exist, create it with that content.

#### Step 3 — Pin first-party deployment mode

Add `"deploymentMode": "1p"` to the standard config file:

**macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

**Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

Example (merge with any existing keys — do not delete your `preferences` block):

```json
{
  "preferences": { },
  "deploymentMode": "1p"
}
```

#### Step 4 — Relaunch

```bash
open -a Claude
```

Optional one-shot override if Desktop still picks up stale 3P state:

```bash
/Applications/Claude.app/Contents/MacOS/Claude --boot-1p-once
```

Stop the anygate server (`Ctrl+C` in its terminal) if you no longer need the gateway.

#### How to confirm it worked

- Normal **Chat** tab and Anthropic sign-in flow are back
- No **Cowork 3P \| Gateway** label in the bottom-left corner
- **Developer** menu is gone from the menu bar
- Logs write to `~/Library/Logs/Claude/main.log` (not `Claude-3p/main.log`) and show `claude.ai account active and logged in`

---

### Option A — In-app (if Developer menu is still available)

Open **Developer** → **Configure third-party inference**, clear or replace the gateway settings, and apply changes. Point **Connection** back at Anthropic's API or remove the gateway block entirely, depending on what the UI offers.

You may still need [Step 2 — Disable Developer Mode](#step-2--disable-developer-mode-manual) afterward — clearing the gateway does not hide the **Developer** menu on its own.

### Option B — Log out → Anthropic sign-in

In 3P mode, **Log out** (bottom-left) can surface the sign-in screen with an option to use Anthropic directly instead of Cowork on 3P. This path is easy to miss; the verified revert above is more reliable.

### Full reset (deletes local Desktop history)

Only if the steps above are not enough and you want to wipe everything under Anthropic's third-party inference data folder:

| Platform | Delete |
| --- | --- |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/Claude-3p/` and optionally `~/Claude/` |
| Windows | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Claude-3p\` and optionally `%USERPROFILE%\Claude\` |

**Warning:** Conversation history in that folder is not recoverable after deletion.

### Managed / enterprise profiles

If IT pushed a managed profile (Jamf, Intune, Group Policy), local edits in `configLibrary/` may be ignored or restored on launch. Talk to IT to remove or update the profile.

---

## Disable Developer Mode

Third-party inference setup requires **Help** → **Troubleshooting** → **Enable Developer Mode**, which reveals the **Developer** menu.

**There is no "Disable Developer Mode" menu item** in Claude Desktop v1.11847.5 (verified in the app bundle). To turn it off after reverting to Anthropic:

1. Fully quit Claude Desktop
2. Edit `developer_settings.json` in the **standard** `Claude/` folder (see paths above)
3. Set `"allowDevTools": false`
4. Relaunch

Once gateway config is removed, the **Developer** menu does not route traffic to your anygate server — but it stays visible until `allowDevTools` is set to `false`.

To re-enable later (e.g. for another gateway experiment): set `"allowDevTools": true` and relaunch, or use **Help** → **Troubleshooting** → **Enable Developer Mode** again.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Gateway config doesn't seem to apply

- Confirm **Connection** uses **Gateway** with a valid base URL and API key
- Config is read at launch. Fully quit and reopen Claude Desktop after **Apply locally**
- **Help** → **Troubleshooting** → **Copy Managed Configuration Report** shows what the app loaded (secrets redacted)
- Logs:
  - macOS: `~/Library/Logs/Claude-3p/main.log`
  - Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Claude-3p\Logs\main.log`

### Test connection or Test model discovery fails

| Check | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Server not running | Start `anygate server` and keep the terminal open |
| Wrong base URL | `http://127.0.0.1:17645/anthropic`, no `/v1` suffix |
| Empty API key | Any non-empty string for local mode |
| Network mode | Base URL uses the server's LAN IP; API key matches the server password |
| Firewall | Allow local connections to port `17645` |

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:17645/health
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer test" http://127.0.0.1:17645/anthropic/v1/models
```

### Model picker shows 0 models or fewer than expected

- **Discovery id masking:** Answer **Yes** in the server wizard. Claude Desktop hides models whose gateway ids contain competitor vendor strings
- **Provider filter:** Re-run the wizard and add the providers you need
- **Favorites-only:** Add models with `anygate models`, or turn favorites-only off
- **Providers:** Run `anygate providers list` — ensure the providers you want are configured

### Models show up in `curl` but not in Desktop

Enable **Mask gateway model ids for discovery**, restart the server, relaunch Claude Desktop.

### `Missing OPENCODE_API_KEY` when starting the server

Run `anygate claude` once to store your key, or export `OPENCODE_API_KEY` before `anygate server`.

### `No providers configured`

```bash
anygate providers add
# or
anygate providers import
```

### Authentication errors from the gateway (401)

- **Local mode:** Any non-empty bearer token works
- **Network mode:** Gateway API key in Desktop must match the server password exactly

### "Failed to add marketplace"

Standard Claude Desktop installations fetch the Cowork VM workspace from `downloads.claude.ai` at session start. If the diagnostic report shows `VMDownloadError`, `ENOSPC`, or `Insufficient disk space`, free the amount reported there, restart Claude Desktop, and try again. One reported case required 16.1 GB, but Anthropic does not publish a fixed requirement. Inference can continue working because it does not depend on this VM.

### Generate a diagnostic report

**Help** → **Troubleshooting** → **Generate Diagnostic Report**. Share the saved folder if you need help. No conversation content in the report.
